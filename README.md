### Author: Devin Whitten
### Date: February 18, 2018

This script package contains the ``network_array``, and ``network`` and ``Dataset`` classes, as well as a main driver for use of network training and parameter estimation with J-PLUS photometry.

SPHINX optimizes an array of networks for estimates of stellar surface temperature and metallicity from photometry of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey[1].
